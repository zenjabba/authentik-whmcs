Dear {$client_name},

Your Authentik account has been created. Here are your initial login credentials:

Username: {$service_username}
Temporary Password: {$service_password}

Login URL: {$authentik_url}

IMPORTANT: On your first login, you will be required to:
1. Change your password
2. Set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using an authenticator app

To prepare for this:
1. Download an authenticator app if you don't have one already (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator)
2. Have your mobile device ready to scan the QR code during the 2FA setup

These security measures are in place to protect your account. If you need assistance, please contact our support team.

Best regards,
Your Support Team
